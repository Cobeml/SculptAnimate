# CNC Path Visualizer

This project is a web application that visualizes CNC tool paths on a 3D surface in real-time. It allows users to load a part geometry (STL format) and a tool path (G-code), then simulates the carving process dynamically. The minimal viable product (MVP) focuses on core functionality with a simple yet effective approach.

## Application Overview

CNC Path Visualizer is an interactive tool designed for CNC machinists, engineers, and hobbyists who want to visualize and verify their machining paths before actual production. The application provides:

- **3D Visualization**: Real-time rendering of part geometry and tool paths in a fully interactive 3D environment
- **G-code Interpretation**: Accurate parsing and visualization of industry-standard G-code commands
- **Simulation**: Step-by-step or continuous animation of the cutting tool as it follows the programmed path
- **Material Removal Preview**: Visual representation of material being removed during the machining process
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive controls for loading files, adjusting view angles, and controlling simulation speed
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works on any modern browser without requiring specialized software installation

The application bridges the gap between CAM software output and physical machining, allowing users to identify potential issues in tool paths, optimize cutting strategies, and reduce material waste.
